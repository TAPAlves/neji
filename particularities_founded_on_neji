tree annotations;
NLP steps in a sequential order - only the needed ones are used - Tokenization, POS, lemmatization, chunking, dependency parsing

They use a Deterministic finite automaton to the input string to process the string once and kepp the focus on the interesting things
The DFA and regular expressions are used to get all the names from dictionaries , the equal and similar ones that are linked with an identifier, a concept, allowing infer the founded entity;

Dictionaries: Identifier + List of names;
	IDENTIFIERS : “source:identifier:type:group”;
	NAMES: separated by "|".
	
The priority is defined by a file with the name of the dictionaries by priority order(one per line)

Machine learning is made (through Gimli) using CRFS from MALLET;

paralell processing to improve the efficiency.
